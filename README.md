# This will eventually be deleted
I made most of these when I was just figuring out how github worked and was messing around with different ways of making lua packages.
The libraries here are either extrememly easily implemented (like complex numbers and sets) or I have reimplemented (like matrix).
For now this will be archived, and once I reimplement the neural network it will probably be deleted.

# luaLibraries
Some personal custom libraries I use in Lua
Either as simple reference or a fun exercise (stuff like quaternions) or stuff that I actively use (such as matrix)
